    <h2>Course Contract</h2>
    <p>
      I, <em><a href="./introduction250.html" title="Intro Link">Dajabre Torain-Williams</a></em> agree to abide by the
      terms of the course contract in my Fall 2025
      WEB250-N801 Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor, <em>Professor D.I. von Briesen.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the
      world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
    </p>
    <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.
      As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
    </p>
